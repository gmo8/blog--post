### Art Piece 1

For my first piece, I chose Ghost Pole Propagator by Golan Levin. I chose this peace because I really appreciated the simplicity of it. It left a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It is also an interactive piece, which further enhances the sensation that the viewer is not only able to have room for imagination, but has the freedom to have fun. I appreciate pieces that bring out feelings of both nostalgia and light heartedness, and I think this is one of those pieces.

### Art Piece 2

The second piece I chose was also an interactive piece created by the Nike clothing company. This piece was very colorful and flowed like water across the screen. For me, it served as a reminder that the human body is not just a tool, but also a work of art. This piece was inside the Nike headquarters, so I think the point of this piece was to create the sensation that the body is both fluid and vibrant. I think it was created by Nike to represent the idea that the body is not made up of pieces and that something as simple as a shoe will effect the whole body. Great advertisement if you ask me.
